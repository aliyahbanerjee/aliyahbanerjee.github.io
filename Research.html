    <div class="project-title">Bargaining Under False Promise of Marriage</div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      This project considers household bargaining under uncertainty between couples in live-in relationships, where the female partner faces uncertainty under false promise of marriage by the male partner. I consider mechanism selection and implementation for household decisions, and the impact of informational structures under which selection and implementation is carried out. The ex ante, interim, and "almost ex-ante" (Kim, 2020) structures are considered (the exigence for this project is driven by the newly-implemented Uniform Civil Code in Uttarakhand, India, that mandates the registration of live-in relationships with state authorities and deals with rising cases, and criminalisation, of false promise of marriage).

    <div class="project-title">Young Women Self Help Group Membership in
Uttar Pradesh: How Does Independent
Decision-Making Matter?</div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      This paper explores how decision-making
independence impacts the membership of Young
Women Self Help Groups (YWSHGs), a popular
and effective poverty alleviation measure in Uttar
Pradesh, India. Adapting Houtenville and Conway’s
2008 theoretical model, I illustrate how increased
independence of adolescent women in matters of
their education, marriage, employment, and finances
may lead to higher membership probability and lower
socioeconomic barriers to membership. Empirically,
using a dataset of 872 adolescent and young women
aged 15-21 surveyed in rural Uttar Pradesh, I find that:
1. SHG membership has tangible financial benefits
for higher-educated young women, 2., membership
probability increases for General caste young women,
and 3. membership probability increases even more for
general caste members among non-independent young
women. I suggest reducing household interference in
the life decisions of adolescent women in the region,
through updating legal structures, social policies, and
educational efforts. These recommendations are aimed at
enabling young and adolescent women to partake in Self
Help Groups, with their associated benefits, at higher
rates.

    <div class="project-title">Virtual Buddies: Enhancing Women’s Safety in India through One-Sided Matching (Commentary)</div>
    <a href="https://stanfordeconreview.com/2025/01/03/commentary-virtual-buddies-enhancing-womens-safety-in-india-through-one-sided-matching/" class="project-link">Link to Project 3</a>
    <div class="project-desc">
      Safety apps have become popular solutions to address women’s safety in India, using features like panic buttons, location-sharing, and SOS alerts to enable safe travel at night and aid in instances of sexual violence or harassment. However, a lack of digital literacy, feelings of constraint with location-sharing services, fear of control by abusive partners, data privacy concerns, and perpetuation of sexual violence stereotypes pose significant barriers for female users of these apps. To alleviate these concerns,  using one-sided matching is proposed to build a novel safety platform for women.
